/**
 * Fuel / cost / CO₂ wording — review finding 2.
 *
 * "Quantify fuel savings and CO₂ reductions" claims measurement. The model does
 * not measure; it estimates, and says so in its own source. FuelModelConstants:
 *
 *   - a VT-CPFM physics model over mass, drag area, rolling resistance and grade
 *   - constants drawn from LIGHT-DUTY tables, with per-segment defaults, not from
 *     the user's actual vehicle
 *   - a per-user coefficient solved against a SYNTHETIC WLTC-class reference
 *     cycle, not against measured fuel use
 *   - a display-time plausibility guard clamping the result to 0.5–2.0x the
 *     baseline, which only exists because the estimate can be that far out
 *   - and, in the file's own words, every value is "PROVISIONAL pending
 *     Phase-B field validation"
 *
 * There is no ground truth anywhere in the product. Pricing and Help already
 * said "estimate"; Features and HowItWorks were the outliers.

/**
 * NO \b ANCHORS. textContent concatenates adjacent element text with NO

 * reason. This bit three separate specs in this workstream. Plain substrings.
 *
 * "measure" is deliberately absent: the apps' own honest framing is a screen
 * called "What we measure", which this site should eventually adopt.
