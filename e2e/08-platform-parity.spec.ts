 * cluster: they were found in the hero, the exit popup, the release notes, the
 * feature grid, the nav dropdown, the FAQ, the footer and the accessibility page.
 *
 * Chasing them one at a time is how you miss the ninth. This spec instead crawls
 * EVERY route and asserts parity invariants, so the whole class is visible in one
 * run and a regression anywhere fails immediately.
 *
 * The rule is NOT "never mention iOS". Platform-specific facts are fine and often
 * required — CarPlay really is iPhone-only. The rule is that an iOS-exclusive
 * technology must be either QUALIFIED (named as an iPhone feature) or BALANCED
 * (its Android counterpart named on the same page). Silence is what misleads.

 *  - QUALIFICATION is judged on the statement PLUS its heading trail. The trail
 *    must be the full ancestor stack, not the nearest heading: the Privacy
 *    Policy scopes "Apple Maps (MapKit) powers the live drive map" with the h2
 *    "1. The Efficiver iOS app", two levels above the h3 it sits under. Reading
 *    only the nearest heading called that correctly-scoped sentence a lie.
 *  - BALANCE is judged on the statement alone. Widening it to the section is
 *    the same escape hatch one size down: Help's "Key Features" list says
 *    "Full-screen Apple Maps view" in one bullet and "open it in Apple or
 *    Google Maps" — a different feature entirely — four bullets later, and
 *    section-wide balance let the first bullet pass on the second's wording.
 *
 * Bolded label paragraphs ("On iPhone:", "On Android:") count as headings.
 * They are how Help actually scopes its two accessibility lists, and ignoring
 * them would flag correctly-labelled copy.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT, measured rather than assumed. A negative-control injection
 * proved this catches unqualified VoiceOver / Apple Maps / SwiftData / Siri in
 * a fresh paragraph — but the SAME injection appended to an existing paragraph
 * that already contained the word "iPhone" was NOT caught, because the block is
 * the qualification unit. So a long paragraph mentioning iPhone once can still
 * shelter an unrelated iOS-only claim later in that same paragraph. Keeping
 * claims to one block each is what makes this check honest; if a page grows
 * long multi-claim paragraphs, tighten this to sentence granularity.
 *
 * It also cannot judge a statement that qualifies itself CORRECTLY but answers
 * incompletely — FAQ's "your data stays on your iPhone" was a true sentence and
 * a misleading answer once Android shipped. Only reading catches that.
