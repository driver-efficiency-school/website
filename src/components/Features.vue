  // Every claim below is checked against the shipping apps (2026-08-23). Platform-
  // specific capabilities are LABELLED rather than stated as universal:
  //  - CarPlay is iOS-only. There is deliberately NO Android Auto surface — Google
  //    ruled a phone-sensor driving dashboard outside the Car App Library's
  //    permitted categories, so it must not be implied here.
  //  - The map is Apple Maps on iPhone and Google Maps on Android (maps-compose).
  //  - iCloud sync is iOS-only; the Android app has no equivalent sync feature.
  //  - "Cornering" was REMOVED: no cornering detection exists in either codebase
  //    (verified — the engine tracks acceleration, braking and idle only).
  //  - Biometric lock is Face ID / Touch ID on iOS and BiometricPrompt
  //    (androidx.biometric) on Android — so the wording is platform-neutral.
